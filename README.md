This repository contains my project

The project is about uploading a datafile and showing it in the jsp file (listed in table).

It shows file upload success and failure messages. 

We can also find a particular data from the list by search by name option.

Explanation:

When the run the application via springboot app, the codes get executed. We now give the localhost:portnumber/fileUpload, the first page is displayed (.jsp).

We choose file from our system repository and upload it here. We get a file successfully uploaded message and the data which is inside the file gets extracted and updated in the table.

When we try giving a id name for search, the particular id's name contact number and salary details will be extracted from the list and shown.

NO DATABASE CONNECTION DONE

Just a local repository temp is created and file gets uploaded there in our system.
